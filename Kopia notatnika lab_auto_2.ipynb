The optimal production quantities also shifted to A=200, B=5100, and C=9300.\n","*   With minimum demands set to A>=200, B>=100, C>=150, the binding constraints were Assembly\\_Hours, Quality\\_Control\\_Hours, and Min\\_Demand\\_A.

This suggests that within this range, Assembly Hours were not the primary limiting factor.\n","*   Introducing a binary variable `open_line` for the production line and linking it to the Assembly Hours constraint resulted in the solver choosing to open the line (`open_line = 1.0`). This decision yielded a total profit of \\$3,515,783.35 (using slightly different base profit and demand values than previous exercises). This implies that opening the line and utilizing the assembly hours was necessary and profitable given the other constraints.\n","*   Interactive sliders were successfully implemented for 'Profit A' and 'Assembly Hours', allowing dynamic modification of these parameters and instant recalculation and display of the optimal solution and total profit.\n","\n","### Insights or Next Steps\n","\n","*   Further sensitivity analysis could be performed by adding sliders for other parameters like profit values for B and C, minimum demands, and other resource constraints to understand their individual and combined impact on the optimal solution and profit.\n","*   The binary variable exercise could be extended by adding a fixed cost associated with opening the production line. This would make the binary decision more complex and allow the model to balance the cost of opening against the potential profit
